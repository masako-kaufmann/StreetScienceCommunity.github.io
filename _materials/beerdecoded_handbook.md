# Goals, targets, and learning objectives

**Purpose**: Make life science tangible & accessible

**Outcome**: Pupils and citizens are aware of DNA, sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, open science, science applications and their impact on their daily life

**Process**: 1.5 days (or less according to modules) practical workshop on beer

**Targets**: Pupils in high school (above 16 years old) and citizens with or without scientific background

**Learning objectives**: at the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- Perform simple laboratory tasks
- Give original examples of microbes and their diverse roles
- Explain what a cell is and what it contains
- Describe DNA as the building block for life
- Give examples of DNA sequencing technologies
- Apply a pre-defined data analysis pipeline
